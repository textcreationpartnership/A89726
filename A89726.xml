            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Halt thou raign, becauſe thou cloſeſt thy ſelf in <hi>White-hall,</hi> guarded with Souldiers at the Commonwealths charge? We tell thee, Nay; except thou leave off thy hypocritical Mock-Faſts, and obſerve the true Faſt which the Lord of hoſts hath choſen, thou muſt alſo likewiſe periſh. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>Is not <hi>this the fast that the Lord hath choſen? To looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to take off the heavie burdens, to let the oppreſſed go free,</hi> and that ye <hi>break</hi> (not <hi>one,</hi> but) <hi>every yoke?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding,</p>
            <p>Have not our burdens been increaſed, like <hi>Rehoboams little finger,</hi> which was <hi>thicker &amp; heavier then his fathers loins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are not ſome of our brethren kept in remote places, from the company of their wives, children, and friends, under cruel and tedious impriſonment, (which is worſe then death) after Tryals, and that they have been acquitted according to the Laws of the Land?</p>
            <p>Do ye not keep others in priſon by your arbitrary Wills, (ſo much heretofore complained of and fought againſt, in times of Kingſhip, as unlawful then; but now, all things muſt be lawful) without bringing them to any legal Tryal at all; contrary to all Law and Juſtice? Is not this notorious Injuſtice? and is it not impenitently and frequently practiſed amongſt you? Is this to do as ye would be done unto? Is not Injuſtice done to one, done to all? For, what is one mans caſe to day, may be another mans caſe to morrow. Yet few lay it to heart: none goeth to White-hall to call for Juſtice, as they ought: for, Preaching, Scribling, nor Printing any thing, will ever prevail, or obtain any Juſtice from him in our caſe, no more then it did with the late King and his party, in <hi>Hampdens</hi> or rich mens caſe, till they were brought under impriſonment, and ſerv'd as they had ſerved others; and then we ſaw it would not be accepted of: and ſo many of them have paid their utmoſt farthing. And yet this is no warning to others: for, <hi>Man being in honor, hath no underſtanding,</hi> (we ſee) <hi>but m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Do they not (as it's ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great) <hi>hate the Traytor, but love the Treaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it not to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to houſe the harbourleſs, to releaſe poor priſoners, and that ye hide not your ſelves from your own fleſh?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs,</p>
            <p>Do not thouſands both in Cities and Country periſh for want of thoſe Comforts?</p>
            <p>Do not poor priſoners ſtill lie roaring out at the Iron Grates, ready to periſh for want of bread, and to be devoured by lice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>releaſed?</p>
            <q>
               <hi>They that be ſlain with the ſword, are better then they that be ſlain with hunger.</hi> 
               <bibl>Lament. 4. 9.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Do ye not, as it were, ſit upon the Pinacle at <hi>White-hall,</hi> beholding the glory of three kingdoms ſubjected under your power, and fallen down to worſhip the devil, your own intereſt, by ſeeking riches and high Titles of honour, more then the honour of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and his poor oppreſſed people?</p>
            <p>Did not ſome of you, about ſeven yeers ſince, fiercely accuſe many members of the old Parliament to be corrupt, and betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of their Truſt, yet never brought them to any legal Tryal, as ye ought to do? and promiſed, that the world ſhould ſee, you aimed at nothing of private revenge, as animoſities, but, that Juſtice might have a free courſe, and the people eaſed and ſecured from ſuch corrupt men for time to come &amp; all this come to nothing, but ſetting your ſelvs up in their rooms. <hi>O brave Officers, O!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now therefore be content; look upon (your own Declarations, and) us, for that it is evident to you, (and all the people of this Nation) if we lye, <hi>Job</hi> 6. 28. in any of theſe things before mentioned, and complained of.</p>
            <p>Hath not the Earl of <hi>Kingſton</hi> long ſince been declared and accuſed in print to be an oppreſſor? (which you cannot plead ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to, conſidering many of the Papers were delivered to Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Worſley</hi> at <hi>White hall,</hi> above two months ſince) and, it's believed, one of the greateſt oppreſſors in <hi>England?</hi> and yet all theſe fat bulls and kine of Baſhan, which oppreſs the poor, and deſtroy the needy, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1. ſlip thorow all your fingers, they are ſo greaſie, that no juſtice can be obtained againſt them from you.</p>
            <p>But this is our comfort,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord God</hi> (our Protector) <hi>hath ſworn by his holineſs, that lo, the days ſhall come upon them, that he will take them away with hooks, and their poſterity with fiſh-hooks,</hi> Amos 4. 2. (And we hope, (in his time) all ſuch rebellious <hi>Sauls</hi> as ye are, alſo.)</p>
            <p>This is he, that in Summer, 1653. procured many deſperate unknown perſons, armed with Guns, Piſtols, Swords, Pike-ſtaves, and other weapons, in a riotous manner, to enter upon the poſſeſſion of another, and by force and arms cut down and carried away about 100 acres of graſs and corn, contrary to the Laws in that caſe made and provided; and no right or juſtice can be had or obtained againſt him for it. By which rule, he may be encouraged to ſend them or ſome other, when he pleaſeth, to cut their throats; and which no doubt he will do, if ever his great Maſter and Coſin <hi>Ch. Stuart</hi> prevail again. And it's thought needful to keep Guards for their ſafety and ſecurity at <hi>White-hall,</hi> which we help to maintain; yet we muſt have none to guard and ſecure us in the Country, though we pay for it, as aforeſaid: nay, they would ſooner take our Arms (if we had any) from us, and expoſe us to the worſt of our enemies malice, as they have done to ſeveral perſons formerly. This is good Juſtice alſo.</p>
            <p>This is he, that aſſumes a priviledge ſtill, as in times of Kingſhip, to anſwer Bills of Complaint exhibited againſt him, upon his Honour; (for it ſeems he ſees no change, ſave in the Name onely) when alas! he has neither honour, nor common honeſty, in his actions, as we could make appear in many particulars, if we could have juſtice againſt him.</p>
            <p>This is he, that hath his hackney-winter-houſe, and his hackney-ſummer-houſe: but the Lord of hoſts will ſmite them both; and the houſes of ivory ſhall periſh, and the great houſes ſhall have an end, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 15. And would you know the reaſon why? <hi>He hath eaten up the vineyard, the ſpoil of the poor is in his houſes; yea, he beats the people to pieces, and grindes the faces of the poor.</hi> Contrary to the expreſs minde of the Lord, even the Lord of hoſts, Iſai. 3. 14, 15. But the wo pronounced againſt him and his fellows, in time may overtake them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall they not riſe up ſuddenly that ſhall bite them, and awake that ſhall vex them? and they ſhall be for booties unto them?</hi> Hab. 2. 7. And if you would know why, read alſo the 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 verſes. Look to it, Tyrants and Oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the viſion is yet for an appointed time; but at the end it ſhall ſpeak, and not lye: though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come; it will not tarry.</hi> Hab. 2. 3. <hi>And what will ye do in the day of viſitation, and in the deſolation which ſhall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help, and where will ye leave your glory?</hi> Iſa. 10. 3.</p>
            <p>Hath not the Lord commanded to execute judgment in the morning, and to deliver the oppreſſed out of the hand of the oppreſſor, under a ſevere puniſhment? <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 11, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11. <hi>But thine eyes and thine beart are not but for thy covetouſneſs, and for thine honour, and for to ſhed innocent blood,</hi> (by keeping men in perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, if not otherwiſe) <hi>and for oppreſſion, and for violence, to do it.</hi> Jer. 22. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. For which cauſe, if it come to paſs thou ſhouldſt be buried with <hi>the burial of an Aſs,</hi> drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of <hi>Sodom,</hi> alias <hi>London,</hi> (where many oppreſſed people are undone, let their cauſe be never ſo juſt, the cure being worſe then the ſore) who ſhall or will lament for him, ſaying, <hi>Ah Lord!</hi> or <hi>Ah his glory!</hi> or Highneſs? None but ſome of his creatures, that have been created by him; and dirt-daubers, that <hi>daub him with untempered mortar,</hi> for preferment and gain, and know they muſt ſtand or fall with him: hath he not good ſtore of them? no doubt, 400. nay 4000 falſe prophets for one <hi>Micaiah,</hi> in theſe times.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>why is he wroth</hi> againſt us, (for telling him the truth) <hi>or why is his countenance fallen? If he did well, ſhould he not be accepted? and if he hath not done well, ſin lieth at his door;</hi> and, <hi>his ſin aſſuredly will finde him out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the oppreſſed Jews complaint, <hi>That the harvest was past, the ſummer was ended, and they were not holpen.</hi> How much greater cauſe then have we to complain as we do, ſeeing Thirteen bloody ſummers are paſt, and winters are ended, and yet are we not holpen?</p>
            <p>We contend for nothing but Juſtice, and it's but Juſtice we crave; and Juſtice we will have. But if he ſtill refuſe to hearken, and put us off with delays, which are equal with denials; then, <hi>To your tents, O Engliſh-men:</hi> then, <hi>ſee to thine own houſe, Cromwel.</hi> (We will not be ridden like French aſſes, though thy ſaddle is upon our backs already.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the oppreſſion of the poor, for the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe (ſaith the Lord) I will ſet him in ſafety from him that puffeth at him.</hi> Pſal. 12. 5.</p>
            <p>It is written of that wicked Tyrant King <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> that <hi>whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive: and whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he pull'd down.</hi> (Like as the old and new Parliaments were toſs'd. Who will appear upon the next ſummons or election, think ye? none but fools, or ſome of his own creatures, that muſt act as he pleaſeth, or elſe be pull'd our by the ears by his ſword-men and muſqueteers, as others have been formerly. <hi>O brave Oliver, O!) But when his heart was lifted up, and his minde hardned in pride, he was depoſed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him.</hi> Dan. 5. 19, 20. <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hiſtory informs us alſo, how <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus,</hi> having got the power into their hands for five yeers, refuſed to reſigne up their authority to the Romans (like our old Parliament) after thoſe five yeers were expired, finding it much ſweeter, and knowing it far ſafer, always to command, then ever to obey: But the Romans took an order with them, and ſo may others do with you, for all your Guards and Armies, if ye will not do it otherwiſe. <hi>Reſpice post te, hominem memento te.</hi>
